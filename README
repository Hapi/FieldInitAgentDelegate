README - field-init-agent-delegate
----------------------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'field-init-agent-delegate' can be used to set initial values for member variables
without touching the source code of the target class. This is useful for testing
purpouses where some specific initial values may be required instead of the default
values.


RUNNIG UNIT TESTS
-----------------
If you like to build this from the source be prepared that some of the tests cannot
be run directly from your IDE. You can, of course, configure your IDE to run those
tests but configurations for that is not included. Instead, all the tests can be
run with Maven. Follow these steps:

	1. Run mvn clean install (or mvn clean package)
	2. Run mvn test -P test-agent
	
The first command builds the agent delegate to be used in the second step and
thus you _must not use 'clean' command in the second step_.
